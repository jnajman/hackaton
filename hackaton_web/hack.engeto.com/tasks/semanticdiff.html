Everyone knows the <b>diff</b> tool, right? The old-school utility taking two files on input and producing how the two files differ from each other. Together with another old-school utility, <b>patch</b>, it pretty much enabled distributed, collaborative software development.<br/> 

But comparing source code as text should not be the end of it. Python code has rules and structure. It has entities like modules, classes and methods. It is possible to compare two versions of a Python project as programs, not as text, taking into account the semantics of the code. Which modules, classes or methods were changed, which were added, removed or moved around. What changed in the entities: were interfaces or contracts changed, or just implementation? Was is core of the program, or some weird, rarely used plugin?<br/>

The goal of this project is to produce a tool that understand Python code and is able to semantically compare two Python program versions (like a baseline and a pull request).

Programs are trees (ASTs) and there are good tools that can read Python into ASTs for you already (<a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/astroid">astroid</a>). Simple semantic diff is probably a tree graph difference problem, for which there might be some nice solutions already in some graph library. Then itâ€™s mostly a matter of determining what changes to look for, what to do with them and how to present them. Plus dealing with pseudo-differences like moving code around, renaming etc.
